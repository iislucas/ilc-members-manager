# Projct Status and Task Tracking

This file is intended for people and AIs to track the TODOs of the project,
flesh them out and continue working on in progress ones.

See the [README.md](./README.md) for details of what this project's goals are.

## Formatting instructions

Milestones and TODOs should be formatted in this way: 

```md
### \[PRIORITY\]: Milestone Descriptive Short title

Longer description of the milestone, and then TODOs within it.

#### \[STATUS\]: TODO Descriptive Short title

* List/Longer description of what needs to be done. 
```

Where `STATUS` is one of: `Completed`, `In Progress`, or To Do; and `PRIORITY` is one of `P0`
(current target, key features), `P1` (next target, good to have), `P2` (one day dreams)
