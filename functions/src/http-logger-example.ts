/*
Assume setup in root README.md file...

To deploy: 

(from root directory, not functions subdirectory)
```sh
npm run deploy:functions
```

To emulate locally, run: 

(from the functions subdirectory)
```sh
npm run emulate
```

Wait a bit for it to show a list of available ports etc and listing of URLs
for different functions. Then... 

```sh
cd functions
npm run emulate
```
And in another shell... 
```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/ilc-paris-class-tracker/us-central1/httpLogger -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "foo": "bar"}'
```

Live-reload works reasonably well. Edit the functions file and rerun.
